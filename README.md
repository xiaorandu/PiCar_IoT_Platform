### 1. Introduction
+ **Technologies: Python, Raspberry Pi, TensorFlow, ElectronJS, AWS IoT**
+ Engineered a PiCar-4WD smart car with **Raspberry Pi**, implementing autonomous navigation and object detection.
+ Developed a remote-control web application using **ElectronJS** for real-time sensor data acquisition via Wi-Fi.
+ Architected and deployed a cloud-based infrastructure on **AWS IoT** for communication, data inference and visualization.

### 3. Autonomous Navigation and Object Detection
+ The fully assembled PicCar-4WD smart car can implement to move under its own power, and be clearly able to perceive its environment. Upon encountering an obstacle, the car can navigate around the obstacle in soem fashions.
+ Implement a more advanced mapping algorithm to indicating obstacles, and utilize A* algorithm for route exploring.
+ Utilize OpenCV for image preprocessing and TensorFlow Liteâ€™s Interpreter API for automate object detection.
